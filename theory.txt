What is object-oriented programming (OOP)

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It emphasizes the concept of objects that have state (attributes) and behavior (methods), and allows for code reusability, modularity, and abstraction.

What are the key principles of OOP?

The key principles of OOP are:
Encapsulation: The bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a class.
Inheritance: The ability to create new classes based on existing classes, inheriting their attributes and behaviors.
Polymorphism: The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways.
Abstraction: The process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable objects.

What is a class in Python?

In Python, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods) that the objects of the class will possess.

What is an object in Python?

An object in Python is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity or a real-world object and has its own unique set of attributes and behaviors.

What is the difference between a class and an object?

A class is a blueprint or template that defines the attributes and behaviors of objects. It represents a generalized concept. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It represents a specific occurrence or realization of the class, with its own specific data and behavior.

Explain the concept of inheritance in Python.

Inheritance is a mechanism in Python that allows a class to inherit attributes and behaviors from another class. The class being inherited from is called the superclass or base class, and the class inheriting from it is called the subclass or derived class. The subclass can extend or override the inherited attributes and methods, and it can also add new attributes and methods of its own.

What is method overriding in Python?

Method overriding is a feature of inheritance in which a subclass provides a different implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to change or extend the behavior of the inherited method.

What is encapsulation in OOP?

Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods within a class, and controlling access to them through encapsulation modifiers such as public, private, and protected. It helps in hiding the internal implementation details of a class and provides a clean interface for interacting with the class objects.

What is the purpose of the self keyword in Python?

The self keyword in Python is used as a reference to the current instance of a class. It is a convention to use self as the first parameter in method definitions within a class, allowing the instance to refer to its own attributes and methods.

What are instance variables and class variables?

Instance variables are variables that are unique to each instance (object) of a class. They hold data specific to an object and are declared within the class but outside any method. Each instance has its own copy of instance variables.
Class variables, on the other hand, are variables that are shared among all instances of a class. They are declared within the class but outside any method using the class keyword. All instances of the class have access to the same copy of class variables.

How are instance variables different from class variables?

Instance variables are specific to each instance of a class and hold data that varies between instances. Each instance has its own copy of instance variables.
Class variables, however, are shared among all instances of a class. They hold data that is common to all instances, and any modification to a class variable affects all instances of the class.

Explain the concept of polymorphism in Python.

Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways. It allows for the use of a single interface to represent different types of objects. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

What is method overloading in Python?

Method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters or argument types within a class. Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense, as it does not allow multiple methods with the same name and different parameter signatures. However, you can achieve similar functionality by using default argument values or variable-length arguments.

What is the role of the __init__ method in a class?

The __init__ method is a special method in Python classes that is automatically called when an object is created from the class. It is used to initialize the attributes of an object with default or provided values. The __init__ method is commonly used to set up the initial state of an object.

How can you achieve multiple inheritance in Python?

Multiple inheritance in Python is the ability to inherit from multiple base classes. To achieve multiple inheritance, you can define a class with multiple base classes separated by commas in the class definition.

What is the difference between composition and inheritance?

Inheritance is an "is-a" relationship where a class derives properties from another class. It represents a relationship between classes in which one class is a specialized version of another class.
Composition, on the other hand, is a "has-a" relationship where a class contains objects of other classes as members. It represents a relationship between classes in which one class has a reference to another class as one of its attributes.

What are abstract classes and interfaces in Python?

Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated and are meant to be subclassed. They define abstract methods (methods without implementations) that must be overridden by the subclass. Abstract classes provide a way to define common interfaces and enforce certain behaviors in the subclasses.
Python does not have built-in interfaces like some other programming languages. However, you can create interfaces in Python by using abstract base classes and defining abstract methods that must be implemented by the classes that inherit from them.

How can you implement abstract classes and interfaces in Python?

Abstract classes can be implemented in Python by using the abc module and the ABCMeta metaclass. By inheriting from the ABC class and using the @abstractmethod decorator, you can define abstract methods that must be implemented by the subclasses.
Interfaces can be implemented in Python by defining abstract methods using the @abstractmethod decorator, without the need for an abstract base class. Classes that implement the interface must provide the implementations for the abstract methods.

Explain the concept of method resolution order (MRO) in Python.

Method resolution order (MRO) is the order in which Python looks for methods to invoke in a class hierarchy. It determines the order in which base classes are searched when a method is called on an object. The MRO is determined by the C3 linearization algorithm and can be accessed using the __mro__ attribute.

What are some advantages of using OOP in Python?

Some advantages of using OOP in Python include:
Code reusability: OOP allows for creating reusable classes and objects, reducing code duplication.
Modularity: OOP promotes modular design, making code easier to understand, maintain, and debug.
Abstraction and encapsulation: OOP allows for hiding internal implementation details and providing clean interfaces, improving code readability and maintainability.
Polymorphism: OOP enables writing flexible and extensible code that can work with objects of different types.
Inheritance: OOP facilitates code reuse and promotes the creation of specialized classes based on existing classes.
Improved code organization: OOP provides a structured way to organize code into classes and objects, making it easier to manage and scale projects.
